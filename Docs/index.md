# MiniAnalyzers Documentation Index

This page is the entry point for documentation of the Mini .NET Analyzers. It introduces the rules, how they work, and how to configure them. It also links to the autogenerated API reference that contains full type and member details.

You can browse the full namespaces and classes in the API reference. For quick access to core types, use these links:

## Main analyzers

### MNA0001: Avoid `async void`
Flags `async void` methods, local functions, and async lambdas assigned to `void` delegates. Skips common event handler shapes to reduce noise.  
Type: <xref:MiniAnalyzers.Roslyn.Analyzers.AsyncVoidAnalyzer> 
### MNA0002: Do not use empty `catch` blocks
Reports `catch` blocks with no executable statements. Skips cancellation exceptions to avoid false positives.  
Type: <xref:MiniAnalyzers.Roslyn.Analyzers.EmptyCatchBlockAnalyzer> 

### MNA0003: Avoid `Console.Write` and `Console.WriteLine`
Matches invocations of `System.Console.Write` and `WriteLine`. Encourages the use of a structured logging API.  
Type: <xref:MiniAnalyzers.Roslyn.Analyzers.ConsoleWriteLineAnalyzer> 

### MNA0004: Use descriptive names
Flags very short or generic identifiers across locals, fields, parameters, and `foreach` variables. Allows `i`, `j`, `k` only in the `for` initializer and supports `.editorconfig` options.  
Type: <xref:MiniAnalyzers.Roslyn.Analyzers.WeakVariableNameAnalyzer> 

## Analysis Runner

The Analysis Runner orchestrates project or solution analysis and produces UI friendly diagnostics.

Type: <xref:MiniAnalyzers.Core.AnalysisRunner>

### Purpose
- Load a `.sln` or `.csproj` and build Roslyn compilations for all included C# projects.
- Attach the selected `DiagnosticAnalyzer` instances and run them efficiently with cancellation support.
- Normalize Roslyn diagnostics into a stable DTO for the UI so they are easy to filter and display.

### What it does
- Accepts either a solution path or a project path along with a list of analyzers and a `CancellationToken`.
- Runs Roslyn analysis and collects diagnostics from all projects that match the language and target framework.
- Converts each diagnostic into a `MiniAnalyzers.Core.DiagnosticInfo` with stable fields:
  - Id and severity as strings.
  - Message as a human readable text.
  - File path, one based line, one based column from the primary location.
  - Analyzer title and the project name.
  - Optional context snippet that surrounds the location and marks the exact span.
- Applies basic ordering so the UI can render a consistent grid.
- Propagates `.editorconfig` options to analyzers through the standard Roslyn pipeline, which enables options like `MNA0004.min_length`.


## EditorConfig options

You can configure rule severity for any analyzer and some rules expose extra options. These settings live in your `.editorconfig` and they flow through Roslyn to the analyzers at analysis time. The UI receives the already evaluated diagnostics and shows them with the chosen severities.

### Severity control for all rules

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0001.severity`  
- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0002.severity`  
- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0003.severity`  
- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0003A.severity`  
- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0004.severity`  

Valid values are `error`, `warning`, `suggestion`, and `none`.

---

### MNA0001 options: Async void

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0001.allow_event_handlers`  
  Boolean toggle that allows common event handler patterns to pass without a warning. Default is `true`.  

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0001.check_anonymous_delegates`  
  Boolean toggle that controls checks for async lambdas assigned to `void` delegates. Default is `true`.

---

### MNA0002 options: Empty catch blocks

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0002.ignore_cancellation`  
  Boolean toggle to ignore `OperationCanceledException` and derived types. Default is `true`.  

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0002.treat_empty_statement_as_empty`  
  Boolean toggle that treats a catch body with only semicolons as empty. Default is `true`.  

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0002.allowed_exception_types`  
  Comma or semicolon separated list of fully qualified exception type names that can be silently caught without a warning. Empty list is treated as not set.  

---

### MNA0003 and MNA0003A options: Console writes

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0003.allow_in_top_level`  
  Boolean toggle to allow `Console.Write*` inside top level statements. Default is `false`.  

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0003.allow_in_tests`  
  Boolean toggle to allow `Console.Write*` in test contexts. Default is `true`.  

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0003.required_prefix`  
  Optional string. When set, messages must start with this prefix, otherwise `MNA0003A` is reported. Default is empty.  

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0003.required_prefix_ignore_case`  
  Boolean toggle that controls case sensitivity for the prefix check. Default is `true`.  

---

### MNA0004 options: Weak or generic names

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0004.min_length`  
  Minimum allowed identifier length after one leading underscore is removed. Range 1 to 50. Default is 3.  

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0004.allowed_names`  
  Comma or semicolon separated list of extra short names that should be allowed. Compared with exact casing.  

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0004.weak_names`  
  Comma or semicolon separated list of tokens that should be flagged even if they meet the length threshold. Compared with exact casing.  

- `dotnet_diagnostic.MNA0004.check_foreach`  
  Boolean toggle that controls whether `foreach` iteration variables are checked. Default is `true`.  

---

### Notes about parsing and lists

- Boolean options accept `true`, `false`, `1`, and `0`. Values are trimmed and normalized before evaluation.  
- For list options you can separate values with commas or semicolons. Whitespace and surrounding quotes are trimmed. Keep the intended casing since comparisons are exact for lists.

## Tests

<xref:MiniAnalyzers.Tests>


Unit tests cover positive and negative cases and often use data rows for compact coverage. The test project exercises each rule with realistic snippets and validates both detection and non detection paths.
